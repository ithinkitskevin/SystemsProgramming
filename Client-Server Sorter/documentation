Proj-3 
---------


Our implementation of proj3 automatically does a dump. It will ask the user to input either "0" for sort request or "1" for dump request.
If 0 is inputed, then the sort request is sent and automatically after that the dump request is sent. 
If 1 is inputed it just does the dump request.
If any other number is entered then this is number is ignore and a dump request is instead.

We had trouble understading how to handle the dump and sort request. At first we understood that the client had to stay in an infinite loop until a dump request was given. But since a dump request always happen, after the initial sort request we are assuming that a dump is needed.

We had a problem where after sending all of the data to the server from the client. 
After our intial sending loop, read and writes were not accepted. 
The client would get stuck as if caught in a loop waiting to read from the server.
the server would 50% of the time get stuck and the other 50% go through to the end.

Our test files are included in the folder client.
The user will be asked to input the number 0 to start the sort request.
